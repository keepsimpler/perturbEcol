Description: perturbEcol simulates the dynamics of ecological systems under environmental perturbations.
    The competition, antagonism (predator-prey), mutualism, and their hybrid ecological
    communities are simulated by dynamic models like Odinary Differential Equations 
    and Stochastic Differential Equations. Two kinds of environmental perturbations
    are modeled in the dynamics: continuous pressures and repeated pulses.
    Species extinction as a special case of perturbation are also modeled. 
    All perturbations can effect on arbitrary setting of species or their interactions.
    Several structural features of interaction topology in ecological communities are simulated:
    scale-free, bipartite, nestedness, modularity, etc.
