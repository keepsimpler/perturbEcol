This R markdown file tests the fragility of mutualistic ecological communities undergoing gradual (incremental) environmental pressures.

First, we need to initialize the running environment of the simulation

```{r}
library(perturbEcol)
library(deSolve)
library(rootSolve)
library(plyr)
library(igraph)

extinct_threshold <- .Machine$double.eps * 100  # threshold of species become extinct
s = 5  # number of species

# Initialize an object of cmModel
cm <- new("cmModel")
cm@times <- 1:200  # time steps
cm@perturb <- perturb_growthrate  # perturbation function
cm@perturbNum <- 500  # number of iterated steps
cm@solver <- sim_ode_press # 
```

Next, we start from a full mutualistic graph, that means all species cooperate with each other.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# mutualistic graph is a full graph
mutual_graph <- matrix(1, nrow = s, ncol = s)
#diag(mutual_graph) <- 0 
# competitive network is a null network
competitive_graph <- matrix(0, nrow = s, ncol = s)
coeff <- c(alpha.mu = 0.2, alpha.sd = 0.1, beta0.mu = 1., beta0.sd = 0.1, beta1.mu = 0.0, beta1.sd = 0.0, gamma.mu = 0.01, gamma.sd = 0.0, h.mu = 0.0, h.sd = 0., delta = 0.)

cm@params <- params_lv2_cm(mutual_graph, competitive_graph, coeff)
cm@init <- init_lv2_cm(cm@params)
cm <- sim(cm, extinct_threshold = extinct_threshold)
plot(cm, main = 'mutual, full graph')
```

We next evaluate the case of hybrid communities.
